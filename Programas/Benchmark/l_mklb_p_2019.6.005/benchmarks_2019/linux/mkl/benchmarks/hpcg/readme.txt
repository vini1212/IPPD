       Intel(R) Optimized High Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark
................................................................................

Package Contents
----------------

This package contains Intel(R) Optimized High Performance Conjugate Gradient
Benchmark (Intel(R) Optimized HPCG) for Linux* OS.
The package is based on the reference implementation of the HPCG benchmark v3.0
with the following additions:

    setup/Make.*
      - Setup files for building a benchmark against optimizations provided
        in Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (Intel(R) MKL).  The build steps are
        described in the HPCG QUICKSTART guide.

    bin/xhpcg_avx
      - Prebuilt executable with HPCG* subroutines optimized for Intel(R)
        Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel(R) AVX).

    bin/xhpcg_avx2
      - Prebuilt executable with HPCG* subroutines optimized for Intel(R)
        Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel(R) AVX2).

    bin/xhpcg_knl
      - Prebuilt executable with HPCG* subroutines optimized for Intel(R)
        Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel(R) AVX512) on Intel(R)
        Xeon Phi(TM) processors (products formerly Knights Landing).

    bin/xhpcg_skx
      - Prebuilt executable with HPCG* subroutines optimized for Intel(R)
        Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel(R) AVX512) on Intel(R)
        Xeon(R) Scalable processors (products formerly Skylake).

For user convenience the package is supplied with prebuilt HPCG* launchers,
allowing out-of-the-box benchmark execution.  First, setup the runtime
environment for Intel(R) C/C++ Compiler 16.0, Intel(R) MKL 2018, and Intel(R)
MPI 5.1 or later versions using the scripts compilervars.sh, mklvars.sh,
and mpivars.sh included in those distributions.  Next, run the benchmark on
Intel AVX, Intel AVX2, or Intel AVX-512 enabled Intel processors as follows:

    #> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N_cores_per_node/N_processes_per_node>
    #> export KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,1,0
    #> mpiexec.hydra -genvall -n $nprocs -ppn $nprocs_per_node bin/xhpcg_avx  -n$problem_size -t$run_time_in_seconds
    #> mpiexec.hydra -genvall -n $nprocs -ppn $nprocs_per_node bin/xhpcg_avx2 -n$problem_size -t$run_time_in_seconds
    #> mpiexec.hydra -genvall -n $nprocs -ppn $nprocs_per_node bin/xhpcg_knl  -n$problem_size -t$run_time_in_seconds
    #> mpiexec.hydra -genvall -n $nprocs -ppn $nprocs_per_node bin/xhpcg_skx  -n$problem_size -t$run_time_in_seconds

Note: Problem size should be multiple of 8 and at least 24.

Reference HPCG code in the ./src directory was modified in order
to bundle Intel(R) architecture optimizations with the shared libraries.
